## Step 2
**Add a Bot**
[Login]([https://dbots.co/login) to the DBots Dashboard to your server.
This will redirect you to a Discord oauth link which should auto login to DBots, with your currently logged-in Discord account.
After logging into the dashboard, you can [add a bot](/dashboard/bots/new) by clicking on the '+' icon.
